## Testing

The deployment script can be tested with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act). Define your secrets::

    # edit the resulting .secrets file
    cp .secrets.sample .secrets

Note that multi-line strings are not supported in secrets files, so you should replace carriage returns by "\n".

Then run::

    act workflow_dispatch
